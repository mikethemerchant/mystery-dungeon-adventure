    "description": "Adult Blue Dragon is a fearsome sight to behold. It measures around 70 feet in length and weighs over 60,000 pounds. Its scales are a deep, electric blue color with darker spots, and its eyes are a piercing yellow. The dragon's wings are immense and powerful, allowing it to soar through the skies with ease, and its long, sinuous tail ends in a sharp, barbed point. The Adult Blue Dragon is an intelligent and cunning creature, with a love for treasure and a fierce protective streak. It often lairs in the heart of vast deserts, in ruined cities or ancient tombs, where it can easily defend its wealth and territory. The dragon is highly territorial and aggressive, attacking any creature that enters its domain without permission.  In battle, the Adult Blue Dragon is a formidable foe, capable of breathing a blast of lightning that can level entire buildings or incinerate its enemies. Its massive jaws are lined with razor-sharp teeth, and its claws and tail can strike with tremendous force. Only the most skilled and courageous adventurers would dare to face this powerful beast in combat, and even they would do well to tread cautiously.",
